## Project Layout

- `/features`
This is the typical directory Cucumber code is placed in. For now, this structure is mandatory as it is what Ruby's Cucumber runner expects.

  - `/features/step_definitions`:
  This is the typical directory Cucumber step definitions are placed in. This example places them here in a module.
    - `/features/step_definitions/cucumber_rust.wire`:
    This is a mandatory file that indicates to Ruby Cucumber that there is a server out there to handle executing our steps. That's this library!

    - `/features/step_definitions/*.rs`:
    These are the modules our step definitions live in. This organization strategy is not mandatory.

  - `/features/support`:
  This is a typical directory for support code for step execution in Cucumber. In this project, the World is defined here.

  - `/features/cuke.rs`:
  This the test running code. It can have any name, but to be executed, the `Cargo.toml` must know where it is.

  - `/features/*.feature`:
  These are the "features" that the application claims to have. See general Cucumber documentation for more information. These may be organized in any way Ruby Cucumber permits features to be organized, generally meaning "anywhere in the `/features` folder or its sub-folders.

- `Cargo.toml`:
This file is Rust-normal, except for the special treatment for binary projects. Cucumber needs a crate to test against, so you __must__ build a lib if you want to test it directly. This project uses a `bin.rs` file, and a special directive in the `toml` to expose a binary to run.
